# PyCitySchools
## Background
Given two data sets: [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/rflammia-py/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/rflammia-py/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/Resources/students_complete.csv), I used python pandas to import and merge the aggregate data and displayed them in data frames. I completed the project in Jupyter Notebook


## Observable Trends

    The overall passing rate for reading: 85.805463
